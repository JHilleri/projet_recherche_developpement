\section*{Resume}

In this papers, authors present, define and classify different kind of \textit{production scheduling-vehicule routing problem (PS-VRP)}. This class of problem make part of the IPODS problem (Chen 2010) but considers only problem using a VRP as delivery aspect. For example, it excluse IPODS problem with single customers, direct shipement or using other transportation mod (as airplane).
The main axe of classification of this paper is related to the scheduling environment, it separe single machine and parrallele machine and job/flow shop. Authors classify the treaten problem of the literature by the production, inventory, distribution, fleet and objective aspect take in account in the problem.
